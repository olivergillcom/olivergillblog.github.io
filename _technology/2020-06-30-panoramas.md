Views are immersive so why cut them short? These days you don't have to buy special equipment or software to make a nice panorama (Google Photos even auto-creates them for you), though that didn't stop me buying a panoramic film camera.

Interact with them to reveal their full widescreen beauty

### Let's desaturate
Panoramas on film already have a movie-aesthetic, so why not go the full distance and use black and white film

### Why so sideways?

Another cool technique, which _really_ doesn't translate well to modern social media is portrait panoramas. These will probably look awful on any device but could potentially be a cool addition to a wall.
