### Image galleries

A few of my favourites:

<div class="gallery" data-columns="3">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-portrait.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-square.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape-2.jpg">
</div>

### Why so sideways?

Another cool technique, which _really_ doesn't translate well to modern social media is portrait panoramas. These will probably look awful on any device but could potentially be a cool addition to a wall. 

<div class="gallery" data-columns="3">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-portrait.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-square.jpg">
</div>
