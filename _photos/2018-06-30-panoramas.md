Views are immersive so why cut them short? These days you don't have to buy special equipment or software to make a nice panorama (Google Photos even auto-creates them for you), though that didn't stop me buying a panoramic film camera This page is a demo that shows everything you can do inside portfolio and blog posts.

We've included everything you need to create engaging posts about your work, and show off your case studies in a beautiful way.

### Why so sideways?

Another cool technique, which _really_ doesn't translate well to modern social media is portrait panoramas. These will probably look awful on any device but could potentially be a cool addition to a wall.
