# Cameras

## Rangefinders
### Leica M-P Typ 240
##### Bought August 2015 from Richard and Ben at the Leica Store, Manchester
![](/images/pages/cameras/mp240.jpg)

The big kahuna. Since seeing a magazine advert for the Leica M8 I have been hampering after a red dotted rangefinder, ironically to then buy the one without a dot.

While agreeing with the common criticism, that for a Leica it is rather large and remarkably heavy, it is tiny compared to a DSLR and delivers where it matters most. The image quality combined with the 'Leica look' give even the most banal situation a magical quality - eluded to in this WIRED review.

It remains as my only digital camera and though my interest in digital has waned, and that resale value could easily pay for several months off work, it remains as my go-to for unpredictable situations.


### Hasselblad X-Pan
##### Bought December 2015 from Ward at the Camera Museum, Central London

The X-Pan is my travel camera of choice, originally purchased to scratch a specific landscape itch left by the street-orientated Leicas.

Hasselblad co-engineered this camera with Fuji, with the latter releasing a self-branded version in Japan, along with very limited numbers of an optional wooden grip. After finding a rare import from Japan, one now adorns my X-Pan - as if I needed to look more hipster.

The versatility of switching between standard frame-lines to a double-sized panoramic is as quick as it is powerful. A dynamic which will keep the Hasselblad the film camera I reach for first, for years to come.


### Leica M6 Classic
##### Bought November 2015 from Costa, in London

After making a large hole in my wallet with the digital Leica and associated glass, I fancied a film camera to make the most of the ridiculously capable lenses.

I followed a fan-made decision tree to find which M I was best suited to and, with a meter but without auto exposure, I arrived at the fully mechanical M6 Classic. The exposure dial being the 'old' or 'wrong' way round continues to defy me but luckily the inbuilt metering gives me enough warning to save the shot.

With most of my 2016 film photography being landscapes, the M6 has not had many outings but when out with friends or in need of intimate portraits, this camera is second to none.

## SLR
### Canon EOS-1
##### Bought April 2011 from eBay, for £40

After investing significant money in Canon glass for my 5D back in 2010, I wanted to experiment with film having never used it seriously before. I sought the oldest, cheapest 'decent' EOS-mount body I could find which to my surprise turned out to be a professional flagship dating from my birth year, originally costing more than £4000.

Unfortunately fairly soon after this purchase university and subsequently work got in the way. I sold my 5D and lenses leaving the EOS-1 partner-less for two years, having only exposed one roll of film.

After the passing of my photographic dark ages, I picked up a nifty-fifty and a roll of Ilford XP2 - the pairing which my interest and love of film grew. 

 
### Olympus OM-1 MD
##### Acquired April 2016 from my Dad. Bought, by him, mid 1975 in Colchester, UK

The camera that started it all. 

Having traveled around the majority of Africa, North America, and Europe with my father, one of the Olympus's last accomplishments before retirement from active duty was getting me into photography. A holiday in France armed with the zoom lens and an extender kept me occupied, taking tele-photo shots of the surrounding area. I had no idea what I was doing and I don't think a single shot survived that session but importantly the seed was sewn.

After digging the OM-1 out of the attic over 15 years later, I was surprised to find everything still working including the original 70's 1.35v mercury battery used for the inbuilt needle-meter.

I have this camera more for sentimental reasons than to scratch a practical photography itch, but I am no museum and hope to take it out in the future.


### Mamiya RZ67 Professional
##### Bought May 2016 from Steve at B&H Photo Manhattan

![](/images/pages/cameras/rz67.jpg)

After promising myself I would not buy any more cameras before getting a place of my own, it took surprisingly little to convince me otherwise. Armed with a spare afternoon in Manhattan, a friend mentioned that B&H had their only physical store by Madison Square Garden. Ten minutes and a cross-town Uber later I was in front of a full shelf of medium format cameras.

In what felt like another ten minutes (but in reality was more like forty) my guide Steve extolled the virtues of each system and together we whittled down the specimens on the shelf to a few variants of the RZ67. A few accessory swaps later and my camera was sent on the elaborate B&H conveyor system to the checkout.

The newest addition to the family, I am yet to really get to grips with the nuances of Medium Format photography. The Mamiya is also my only fully manual camera.
