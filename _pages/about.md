# Personal

Since putting together my first computer aged four, I have been the technology enthusiast that friends, family and latterly clients have come to for help with what they have, and the technology evangelist they come to for advice on current and future technology.

After studying modern languages in school I switched to digital languages with a Computing Science degree from Newcastle University. Whilst my interest in coding never grew further than as a hobby, learning about algorithms and development cycles had a resounding impact on my understanding and appreciation of the field â€“ something that comes as a benefit whilst managing development teams.

My professional career has spanned multiple job titles and industry sectors. Whilst my responsibilities and my level of interaction with clients have grown, three consistent success factors have remained; understanding the current and upcoming technology markets, finding the root cause of a client or market problem, and working with people from different companies, backgrounds, cultures and locations to create solutions that help drive measurable success.

I am a great advocate of learning-through-doing, and the skills I list on my professional profile have for the most part been built through experience and experimentation rather than from slide decks or blogs; assessing what works best, adapting, and learning. It is important to me that an advisor knows the detail in what they are advising, and when information is a Google search away it is that depth and detail of practical knowledge which delivers results and adds value.

My passion for technology continues at home with personal projects featuring in popular technology blogs such as [The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/2012/5/1/2992041/nokia-lumia-800-wireless-charging-mod) and [Gizmodo](http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2012/05/hack-a-lumia-800-for-inductive-charging/). I am a keen hobbyist currently working on my own Connected Home. I am also a published photographer working with both film and digital, my most viewed photograph being a portrait of Sir Paul McCartney which has served as his Wikipedia [profile picture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_McCartney#/media/File:Paul_McCartney_black_and_white_2010.jpg) for several years.
