### Overarching Theories, Concepts, and Opinions

Once you have a fundamental bedrock of understanding its pretty easy to opinionate on new things pretty quickly, sussing out what needs to be tested, questioned or verified.

##### Abstraction and Frameworks
At first these two words can fill you with a sinking feeling, but rather than adding complexity they actually make everything a lot simpler. At it's absolute highest level think of abstraction as a human translator; you say or want one thing, and the translator will understand it and convert that to something else. It is not up to you to do the translation, you have in effect offloaded that responsibility to the (hopefully well paid) worker to take care of it. You can think of frameworks as published rulebooks that you can use, using the same analogy we could call dictionaries a framework - one that the translator will use to adapt what you want to say in one language, into the end result you are after. 

##### Tools
Realtimeboard
Trello
Jira
VS Code
Docker



When one of my computer science lecturers began to teach us the basics of abstraction, through functional mathematics, half of the students mentally switched off.

##### Open Source Software
Not always a silver bullet, open source is only "good" if it is actively maintained

##### Agile Design & "Fail" Fast
Often used by corporates as a legal get-out-of-jail-free card

##### User Centricity
A user doesn't have to be human, if you aren't designing things with interactions in mind you're setting yourself up for infinite headaches later

##### Self-Host vs Cloud

##### Ecosystems
Windows vs Mac
iPhone vs Android

One of the most frequently 

##### Interoperability and playing well with others

##### "Value" and Priority
people underestimate how much mundane actions affect you

##### Understand your limitations
"I don't know" is a valid answer
"I'm not sure but my guess would be" is also as valid
