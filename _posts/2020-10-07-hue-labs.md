# Making the most of Philips Hue

For some reason the default functionality in the Philips Hue app is really lacking - even though a more fuller feature-set has been available in their "Beta" Hue Labs area. Let's look at what Hue Labs is, how to use it, and what in there is worth investigating.

## Hue Labs

Hue Labs is kind of a "Beta"/"Early-access" area of the Hue app where you can add extra functionality to the various parts that make up the Hue ecosystem. I say "kind of" because as far as I can tell nothing has ever been promoted from there into the full app - despite the name it appears Hue Labs is just where Philips stick the slightly more complex items to keep it away from the majority of users.

For example I have had ability to have three time periods for sensors since 2016, yet still you are restricted to two in the app, even though I would argue this is a fundamental requirement to almost any use-case.

### Finding and Navigating Hue Labs
Luckily if you already use the Hue app, you already have it, it's just hidden away in the __Explore__ tab

Not entirely sure why they hide it away quite so much but we're not making a list of Hue user experience (UX) issues ... we'd be here a while. Back to task, when you click on Labs you will be taken to what appears as a webpage in the app (see what I mean about UX yet?). The "Homepage" shows some info about your devices which otherwise isnt available anywhere else, their latest blogpost, and a handful of featured "Formulas".

You can have a quick look at the featured formulas or (given they aren't in any particular order) you might as well click __Formulas__ at the top and go to the dedicated page for it. Here you will be presented with a rolling list of addable functionality you install to really get the most of your Hue experience.

These formulas are mix of pre-made scenes, functions, and shortcuts and on the header image of each item it will show what device(s) you need in order to use it. You can't sort or filter this list so maybe dedicate a few minutes to scrolling all the way through to make sure you don't miss anything useful.

</div>

Tapping __Try It__ on any of these will expand a section below that card (scroll down if you can't see it) from there you can tweak all the settings and install it.

If you ever want to go back and modify/delete these add-ons you've installed, then that's where the third tab at the top comes in __My Labs__.

Clicking through on any of the formulas in __My Labs__ will show you where you've installed it - yes you can install it more than once, for example if you have two sensors and want them to both have three time segments but behave differently.

Quick note: While __Three Times a Charm__ is a good function to give you that coveted third timeslot, almost every other sensor formula I've used also has a third window, so maybe explore what else you could do before deciding which formula to apply.


As an example, I use __Do not disturb my scene__ which has a third slot but also means that it won't override any changes you do to the scene whilst being in the room - maybe you have friends over and want your lounge scene to be a bit brighter or want to customise a scene for a bath without it switching to normal every 10mins.

Finally, here's how I have the sensor in my bathroom set up in case you get stuck:
