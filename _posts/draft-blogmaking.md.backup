# TIL, you can spin and post on a free open source blog or website in less than 5 minutes...

I have often seen websites as subdomains of (ending with) github.io and never really though much of it - having assumed it was to do with githubs premium tiers which I have never had the need to explore. Turns out it's a free option (one per person/organisation), with all your data hosted for free on github.

# The basics

## ultra high-level code chat
If content is king, it's because abstraction is the queen that got him there. What i mean by that is, long-gone are the days of micromanaging .html pages for websites in the same way you only need to upload a photo to instagram or facebook to have it viewable and interactable by those you care about (and an army of likebots).

Sites like Squarespace and (to a lesser extent but still) Wordpress are good website-examples of where, after a small amount of design, you feed it the thing you want to share, and it's shared.

I have used both (still do at time of writing) and they most definitely have their usecases. Squarespace is great if you want a zero-code website that looks great out of the box but you pay for the privilege. Wordpress is essentially a CMS (Content Management System) which happens to have a website portal, it is engineered for those with a huge amount of content to put out

## Github

Github is a code repository service, which just so happens to also provide Github Pages, which converts files in in a certain structure into working webpages. Sure your website's files are public but...its a public website, it's no different to going on a website and viewing the source.
