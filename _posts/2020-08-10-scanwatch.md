At time of writing, the ScanWatch is the upcoming flagship smartwatch/fitness-tracker by Withings. It’s due to go on sale in early September for €279 - I’m on their insider programme so have it a little early.

## Hardware
The design is nice, feels like another evolution of the design language they came to the market with 5-6 years ago, which isn’t a bad thing given the simplicity of design - honestly can’t say that it feels stale yet.

Simple analogue watch face, two complications; one being an oled display for smart-stuff, the other being a %-dial for your daily activity (based on the goals you set yourself in the app). 

Bodywise, it still has an annoying bubble/convex dome shape underneath which seems to plague all smartwatches. They all look svelte on the press/review images but when you see them in person you realise they have cleverly tapered sides - so it’s actually way thicker on your wrist than at first glance. 

I went for the smaller (38mm) one as it could have been a potential hand-over to my girlfriend who’s in the market for a smart(er)-watch but the aforementioned domed underside means it just looks out of place on smaller wrists.

Dimensionally, it fits my male-but-not-manly arms pretty well, though I think I could get the bigger (42mm) model without issue, and probably would if I were to purchase again.

At time of writing they haven't updated their accessories store to show which additional/replacement wristbands are compatible (even though it was there for the earlybird purchase-flow). The default rubber strap feels much like what you’d find on a standard Fitbit - nice, not sticky/tacky but can see it being a bit gross if you get sweaty over the summer months. They have a large selection of alternatives so swapping it out won't be a problem once the store is connected up, which I suspect is just a symptom of this being pre-release - there’s a tan leather one with my name on it.


## Software
I’m already fairly deep in the Withings ecosystem (the key reason for going for this in the first place) so setup was as easy as any other mobile-paired accessory (Open App > Add Device > Bluetooth Pair > Sorted). It’s also one of the only times I’ve actually used a “welcome to your…” device introduction, by being detached from the device itself you’re able to “play along” while reading the guide - this isn’t anything particularly innovative but noteworthy given how rare I’ve felt genuine interest in participating.

All functions work as well as you’d expect, only mild annoyance is my resting heart rate is around the lower limit of what the ECG tests (apparently) need, so I may have to walk around a bit before doing the test in future.

Other than that I have no underlying health issues (touch wood) so not really able to read into the data more than face value. All shows as green and within normal ranges = all good with me. 

## Wrap Up
So, overall positive vibes so far, no hiccups/dramas during set-up which somehow still isn’t a given in 2020. The data sits next to all the other sources in the HealthMate app which again is not a given. 

Now I just need to go out and put some steps into the count.
